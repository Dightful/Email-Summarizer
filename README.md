# Email-Summarizer
An application that i use to summarize my emails.

It uses the library Sumy. Sumy is a Python library for automatic text summarization. It supports various summarization algorithms, and in this code, i use the LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) algorithm.

Given an email text, the code will output a condensed version by extracting the most important sentences. This helps in quickly understanding the key points of the email without reading the entire text.
